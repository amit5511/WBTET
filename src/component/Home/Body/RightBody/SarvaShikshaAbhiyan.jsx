          the Primary School Health Programme already undertaken by the Board
          will go a long way to reach the target sets by the SSA. A Plan of Action
          containing definite Project Proposals was submitted to State Project
          Office of SSA during March, 2006.<br />

          to launch some significant programmes in the areas primary education.</p>
