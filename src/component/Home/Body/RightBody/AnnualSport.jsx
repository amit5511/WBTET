          Meet usually organized in<br />
          The districts under the initiative of the board. This is perhaps a unique
          one in the whole of the country at the primary education level. A number
          of events (nearly 35) are held. Last year the Meet was held in the district
          of Dakshin Dinajpur. Important dignitaries including Hon'ble Minister-in-Charge
          of the School Education Department Shri Kanti Biswas, Shri Narayan Biswas,
          the then Minister-of-State, Smt Eva Dey, Minister-of-State, Department
          of School Education graced the annual sports meet by their presence.<br />
          This year (2006) the Meet was held in Diamond Harbour in South 24-Parganas
          during 28 to 30th January, 2006. Important dignitaries including Shri
          Kanti Biswas, the then Hon'ble Minister-in-Charge, School Education,
          Government of West Bengal and Smt. Iva De, the then Minister of State,
          School Education, Govt. of West Bengal graced the occasion by their presence
          and encouraged the participants. The district of North 24-Parganas won

          It is needless to mention that holding of this type of sports meet at
          the primary education level is unique in nature and is quite in tune with
          the objective of the Board to make every student a full-fledged healthy
          citizen of future India.</p>
