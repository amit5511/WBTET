        <p class="pclass">The Board, it is well-known is on the threshold of entering into a new era of universalization 
        of primary education in West Bengal. The growing responsibilities as 
        a matter of fact, call for wide capacity building. The need for completion 
        of all infrastructural facilities in its new administrative headquarters 
        as well as that of setting up of some special cells are also emergency 
        in nature. Besides the ongoing programmes as noted above, implementation 
        of some other important programmes now seem to be an imperative. Some 
        such programmes and cells are mentioned below:<br /><br />
        I. Two-day sensitization programme for all the officials, stakeholders 
        and others connected with primary education at the village Panchayet 
        level in respect of the renewed curriculum and syllabuses.<br /><br />
        II. Qualitative Improvement of Teacher Education imparted by the PTTls: 
        Physical infrastructure and capacity building through refresher courses. 
        Renewal and Revision of Curriculum and Syllabuses.<br /><br />
        III. Development of Course Materials for Trainees in the PTTls.<br /><br />
        IV. Setting up of (i) Research and Impact Study Cell, (ii) A Well equipped 
        Library (iii) Documentation Cell. Proposals for setting up of these 
        cells have also been submitted to the State Project Office of SSA.<br /><br />
        V. Orientation of the Textbooks writers at the primary level.<br /><br />
        It is earnestly and sincerely hoped that Board in close collaboration 
        with WBDPEP, Paschim Banga Rajya Prarambhik Siksha Unnayan Sanstha and 
        other sister organizations will soon usher in a new era in the arena 
        of primary education in West Bengal.</p>
