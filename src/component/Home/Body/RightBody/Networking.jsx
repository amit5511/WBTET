        <p class="pclass">The West Bengal Board of Primary Education has become a member of the
          Council of Boards of School Education (COBSE) in India. A brief profile
          of the Board was duly despatched to COBSE and paper on Continuous and
          Comprehensive Evaluation prepared by Dr. Sulapani Bhattacharya, President
          was sent to the conference of the General Body of COBSE.<br />
          It is heartening to note that the Board is gradually extending its network
          with other educational bodies at the national level. A number of Project
          Proposals sent to the Department of Measurement and Evaluation, NCERT
          were accepted by the Department and were approved for implementation by
          the Regional Institute of Education, Bhubaneswar under the aegis of the
          State Coordination Committee, involving participants from West Bengal.
          Training of Teachers in Research Methodology, Science Teaching in Primary
          Schools are a few to mention where teachers/teacher-educators from West
          Bengal participated. Dr. Sarala Rajput in a letter to Board conveyed her
          Departments' willingness to shoulder the responsibility of holding some
          surveys.<br />
          The West Bengal Board of Primary Education is possibly the only Board
          that could cater to the requirement as per Supreme Court's verdict, for
          study of environmental sciences within its curricular area. The President
          of the Board on being invited by the Director, NCERT participated in the
          national level conference recently held in New Delhi.<br /><br />
