          Education Act promulgated as early as in 1973 and amended from time to
          time vests in the West Bengal Board of Primary Education the development
          both in quantitative and qualitative terms, supervision, management and
          control of the entire primary education in West Bengal. The Board claims
          uniqueness on two distinct counts:<br />
          * In the whole country the Board is the only one that has been created
          and entrusted with the sole authority to manage, supervise, develop and
          control primary education in the state.<br />
          * Quite in tune with the avowed policy of the State Government, the Board,
          a democratically elected autonomous body, symbolizes democratization and
          decentralization of the entire primary education in the State. As many
          as 19 District Primary School Councils in the districts, all democratically
          elected bodies, work for primary education under the aegis of the Board
          which is headed by its President, who is assisted by an Executive Secretary.<br />

          vested in it by the West Bengal Primary Education Act, 1973 is given below:<br />
